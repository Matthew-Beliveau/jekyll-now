I am a senior at UMass Lowell pursuing as Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I am expected to graduate in December 2020. I've worked at Red Hat for a 8 month professional co-op in 2018 and again as a summer intern in 2019. I've obtain write access to GCC after only two weeks. I am currently looking for a summer internship for the summer of 2020 and I am also looking for full time positions starting in 2021. I am particularly interested in Computer Networking/Security, Artificial Intelligence, and compilers.
