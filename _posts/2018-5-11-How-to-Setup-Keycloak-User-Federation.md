title: How to Setup Keycloak User Federation
---

This is the fourth part of my Keycloak and FreeIPA tutorial. I have already setup a FreeIPA server and a Keycloak server

The previous post is here:

[How to Setup Keycloak]({{ site.baseurl}}{% link _posts/2018-6-11-How-to-Setup-Keycloak.md %})

I have already explained how to set up the SSSD User Federation before in another blog post so I'll point to that here:

[Keycloak, SSSD and FreeIPA]({{ site.baseurl}}{% link _posts/2018-4-4-Keycloak SSSD and FreeIPA.md %})

## Next

Will put up link when post is up.
